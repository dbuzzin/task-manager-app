# Task Manager App

I'm stepping away from create-react-app to learn more about webpack and have more control over the bundling and file architecture. I decided to rebuild the whole app again almost from scratch using mostly functional, stateless components. I am now using Redux and Redux Sagas for the state management and async operations. Each task is now sorted into it's respective group based on interaction with it. They can now be created, opened, completed, put on hold and rejected although still all on the client side. "Next steps are to add form validation and build the backend with Node, Express and MongoDB.". 

~~I have chosen to use a combination of Redux and React's context API for the state management to aid in scalability. Tasks are now able to be assigned but currently temporarily stored front end. Next steps are to add form validation and build the backend with Node, Express and MongoDB.~~

~~This app will be using React on the front end and Node on the backend. So far I have laid out some of the UI design which I am now converting to React components.~~
